This repository demonstrates a race condition bug in a bash script. Two processes attempt to concurrently append text to different files. Due to the non-deterministic nature of process scheduling, the final content of the files might not reflect the expected order of operations, showcasing a classic race condition. The solution demonstrates the use of file locking to prevent this issue.
